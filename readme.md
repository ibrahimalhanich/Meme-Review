- 06/14/2020    Started using this [api](https://github.com/R3l3ntl3ss/Meme_Api) to generate memes, but I keep adding new elements to the database whenever I do anything on the page. This is because of the populateDB function being mounted on the router. I will make the database more static by generating the DB using the API call and pasting it into the mongoose server off of their website, will only use the code itself to query the DB instead of generating it.
